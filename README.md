# Heart Health Monitoring System Design

This is a code implementation of our final project for the course ECE 413/513 - Web Development and the Internet of Things, offered in Fall 2023. The primary objective of this project is to develop a low-cost, IoT-enabled web application designed for monitoring heart rate and blood oxygen saturation levels throughout the day. The app features customizable measurement intervals that can be set by either a patient or a physician.

Our team members are:

1. Kory Pearson
2. Raphael Lepercq
3. Natnael Daba

Our implementation has two components:
1. A user firmware for a Particle [Argon](https://docs.particle.io/argon/)  or [Photon](https://docs.particle.io/photon/).
2. A [web application](https://newhearto2monitor.onrender.com/home.html) for visualizing measured values sent from Particle devices.

For a detailed description the user experience and code implementation, chekckout our demo [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8xL6-8aT8E).

## Usage

To use the Heart Health Monitoring System, navigato to the [landing page](https://newhearto2monitor.onrender.com/home.html) and follow the instruction from the demo [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8xL6-8aT8E) which describes how to create a new patient or physician, register a new device to your account, take measurement, and visualize the measured values in your dashboard.

If you want to log in to an already existing patient or physician account and visualize their data, you can the user credentials below:
